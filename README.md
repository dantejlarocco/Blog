# Blog Sample Application

This is a small **Blazor Server** demo project built to showcase clean architecture, adherence to **SOLID principles**, and modern **.NET 6** development practices.  
It demonstrates a minimal **Blog Post Management** module where users can create and view posts using **Entity Framework Core (Code First)**, **Dependency Injection**, and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** techniques.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The project is structured to emphasize **separation of concerns** and **testability**:

Blog/

├── Data/ → EF Core DbContext

├── Models/ → Domain entities

├── Services/ → Business logic (interfaces + implementations)

├── Pages/ → Blazor UI components

└── Tests/ → xUnit unit tests


### Key Design Choices
- **SOLID principles** enforced:
  - **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class has one clear purpose.
  - **O**pen/Closed: Business logic is extendable without modification.
  - **L**iskov Substitution: Interfaces ensure interchangeability.
  - **I**nterface Segregation: Services expose only needed members.
  - **D**ependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions.
- **Entity Framework Core (In-Memory)** for persistence.
- **Dependency Injection** via `Program.cs`.
- **Async/Await** patterns throughout for responsiveness.
- **Clean UI** built with **Blazor** and Razor components.
